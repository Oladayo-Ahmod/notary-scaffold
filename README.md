# Notary DApp

## Description

Notary is a decentralized application (DApp) that facilitates the management and verification of documents on the blockchain. It allows users to securely store documents, verify their authenticity, and revoke access when necessary.

- Users can upload documents to the platform, which are then hashed and stored on the blockchain for security.
- Documents can be accessed and verified using their unique hashes, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
- Users have the ability to revoke access to documents, preventing unauthorized parties from viewing them.

## Features

1. Upload documents to the platform
2. View and verify documents using their unique hashes
3. Revoke access to documents when needed
4. Downloading of authorized documents on the platform
